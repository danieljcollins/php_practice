// don't forget about

// coalescing operator ??
left side = null then right side is executed

// elvis operator ?:
like ternary operator but left side is resolved to be true or false
and if it's false then right side is executed.

where as ternary resolves left side as true or false and then executes
the left side expression besides : or the right side expression

space ship operator <=>
expression resolves to -1 if the left side value is less than the right side
0 if it's equal, and 1 if it's greater
